# 3 Month Training Period
---

This repository will track my training with **Brilliant Infotech** for the **Python Full Stack program**. It serves as a comprehensive collection of my notes and exercises, primarily in **Python Jupyter Notebooks**. Throughout this training, I will be covering a wide range of topics including **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, MongoDB, React, and Django.** This repository will help me *track my progress*, *consolidate my learning*, and serve as a *reference for future projects*.
